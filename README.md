# ClickHouse-DB Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates core data engineering principles, focusing on data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) into an open-source data warehouse.

### Overview

In this project, we retrieve cryptocurrency data via an API, transform it, and load it into a ClickHouse database using client-based connectivity.

### Tools and Technologies

1. **Python**: Utilized for scripting, with the `requests` library employed to fetch data from the cryptocurrency API.
2. **Database Connection**: Established using ClickHouse's client mode, with the potential to expand to JDBC connections for enhanced connectivity.
3. **ClickHouse**: An open-source data warehouse used here for efficient data storage and processing.
